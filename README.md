# 🎄 Advent of Code 🌲

🎁 **Here are my Advent of Code solutions.** 🎁

Currently, they start with the **2025** problems (but I will aim to add my solutions from previous years). I have written my solutions in **C#** (my main language), **Python** and **JS** to try and develop my confidence with the different languages I have been using.

I have attempted to find a clean and elegant solution where possible, but sometimes I have not managed to get this to work correctly. Where I have failed to do this, I am trying to read up on better solutions to learn new approaches, algorithms and syntax that may help me in future problems.

❄️❄️ Most of all, I am having lots of fun trying out Christmas-themed puzzles. ❄️❄️
